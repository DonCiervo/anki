# French (Ultimate) Conjugation - proof of concept

An anki deck to study the conjugations of the most common French verbs

## Basic Functionality:

Creates atomic cards for each relevant and unique (see below) verb conjugation in the French language.

## What makes this deck "randomized" or "more efficient"?

This is my attempt at making the learning process more efficient by showing similar verb forms less often, using a randomizing script.
To illustrate, if you're already familiar with French verbs:
 - the French imparfait and futur simple have six distinct forms each
 - the French passé composé and futur composé are compound tenses and are formed using an auxiliary + the past participle

If each tense had six forms in the deck, a majority of time would be spent studying the auxiliary (avoir / être) and the participle - which is not a good use of studying time.
Instead, in these cases, this deck only creates one card per compound tense, which randomly shows one of the six forms. So even though compound tenses will be shown only an appropriate 1/6 of the time, you will learn and study all of the forms.

In addition, the notes also randomize third person pronouns to make the sentences feel more organic. 


## Disclaimer

I am NOT a French native speaker. I'm a learner, creating this primarily for my own use. If you happen to find any mistake, feel free to raise and issue or create a pull request.
